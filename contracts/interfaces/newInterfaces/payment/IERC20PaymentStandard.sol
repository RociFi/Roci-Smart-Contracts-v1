/**
 * @title IERC20PaymentStandard
 * @author RociFI Labs
 * @dev
 * Payment Standard is meant to be the bare minimum of payment logic required to interact with Bonds
 * and the rest of the ecosystem.
 * Payment contract should only have logic for starting loans (configure and issue),
 * making payments, collecting interest, and retrieving getting loan info.
 *
 * There should also only be **one** Payment contract. The key difference here for Payment Standard is that it is no
 * longer unique to each investor. And instead will share it’s logic with all of them.
 * Payment Standard also should be marked abstract enforcing that it is inherited by it’s child.
 * This means removing all the limits logic and moving it to a child contract like collateral or a specific RociPayment contract.
