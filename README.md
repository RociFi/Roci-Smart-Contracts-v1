# RociFI Protocol

[RociFi](https://v2.roci.fi/app/) is DeFi’s on-chain credit score, under-collateralized and capital-efficient lending protocol on Polygon. 

[RociFi](https://v2.roci.fi/app/) allows borrowers to take fixed-term fixed-rate stablecoin loans with reduced collateral as low as 75%  while giving lenders the possibility to earn interest from depositing their assets into lending pools. 

At the core of the protocol is [Non-Fungible Credit Score (NFCS)](https://blog.roci.fi/nfcs-non-fungible-credit-score-credit-reputation-and-trust-token-3473c9eda458). This is ERC-721 token that prospective borrower mints to see if they are eligible or not for an under collateralised loan. Eligibility is represented in the NFCS score which ranges from 1 (extremely trustworthy) to 10 (not trustworthy) and it is these scores that dictate what loan terms a borrower may take from a pool.

NFCS operates as DeFi’s credit, reputation, and trust credential. To date, [35000 users have minted their NFCS on Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x839a06a50A087fe3b842DF1877Ef83A443E37FbE). Among protocols that use NFCS to vet online reputation of their users are [Cyberconnect](https://blog.roci.fi/rocifi-partners-with-cyberconnect-ef0debef15af) and [RelationLabs](https://blog.roci.fi/rocifi-and-relation-building-credit-and-trust-in-web3-34315714dcee).
